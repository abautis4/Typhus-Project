    "Research in the Computational Biomedicine Laboratory is motivated by fundamental open problems in the broad area of biomedical image analysis, computer vision, bioinformatics, and pattern recognition, with an emphasis on applications that address some of society’s greatest challenges. The overall theme is to develop a comprehensive framework that will lead to improved algorithms for analyzing multidimensional data in search of meaningful information. The ultimate goal is to allow computers to aid humans in taking full advantage of the multitude of data sources available through today’s technology to extract relevant information in an unobtrusive, reliable, accurate, and timely manner.\n",
