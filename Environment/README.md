# Environment folder
In the Environment folder, there are three files with the extension ".txt":

- UHCDSS-pre-processing-environment.txt
- UHCDSS-training-importance-environment.txt
- UHCDSS-classification-environment.txt

These ".txt" files contain the modifiable variables of each stage necessary to use the tool. <mark> THESE ARE THE ONLY FILES THAT NEED TO BE MODIFIED FOR THE USE OF THE CDSS TOOL.</mark>
